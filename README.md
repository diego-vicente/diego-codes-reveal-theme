# `diego.codes` theme for Reveal.js

This repository holds the stylesheet for my personal slides setup, based on [my website's](https://diego.codes). It is based on the [Catppuccin Latte](https://catppuccin.com/) color scheme, and it features some very basic modifications to fit my personal blog look. This code is used in my current setup for quick-and-dirty slide writing, based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [Slides Extended](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-slides-extended) plugin for it.

You can see a brief demo of this slides [here](https://diego.codes/slides/theme-demo).
